![pandas_logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/earthinversion/earthinversion-images/main/images/pandas-python.png)

Pandas is a software library that is quite fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use. It's open source and built on top of the Python programming language. Its main purposes are data analysis and manipulation.

This is usually the first step before data visualization!


# 1. Introduction

There are many resources for learning pandas, here are a few tutorials and courses to get you started.

* [Pandas documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)

* [Data Manipulation with pandas](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas)


* [Python pandas tutorial: The ultimate guide for beginners](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/pandas)
* [Pandas Tutorial: DataFrames in Python](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pandas-tutorial-dataframe-python)
* [DataQuest Pandas Python Tutorial](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/pandas-python-tutorial/)

# 2. Data visualization with Python
Data visualization is about telling a story, and conveing the insights behind a dataset. As a data professional, if you have this skill, it will translate to any of the tools below. 


Before jumping to data visualization, please follow this no-code course:

* [Understanding Data Visualization](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/understanding-data-visualization)


Pick on to get you started, you can explore the rest during the course.

## Extra Practice: Pandas Exercises

Don't get me wrong, tutorials are great resources, but to learn is to do. So unless you practice you won't learn.

There will be three different types of files:  

1. Exercise instructions  
2. Solutions without code  
3. Solutions with code and comments

My suggestion is that you learn a topic in a tutorial, video or documentation and then do the first exercises.

Learn one more topic and do more exercises. If you are stuck, don't go directly to the solutions files. Check the `Guidelines_Results` only and try to get the correct answer.

Suggestions and collaborations are more than welcome.üôÇ 

### ‚ö†Ô∏èImportant notes: Before getting started 

* When looking for resources make sure to note the version of pandas being used as some information may be outdated. 
* Each topic/chapters contains multiple datasets to practice on. Prioritize one dataset per chapter, if there is time, use the other datasets to reinforce what you need more practice on. 
* These exercises are meant to be an extra source of practice for each particular topic. Your coach will provide you with the intructions to tackle this part of the course!
