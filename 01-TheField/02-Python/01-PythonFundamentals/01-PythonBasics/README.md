# Learn to Python

Python is one of the trendiest programmation language for the moment. Easy to learn, Python is often used as an example while learning programmation.

## What is Python?
Python is a programming language invented by Guido Van Rossum. The first version of Python was released in 1991.

  *(The name of ‚ÄúPython‚Äù was chosen to pay homage to the Monthy Pythons.)*

### Python is an interpreted language!

The main difference between a compiled and an interpreted language is as follows: while the compiler translates once for all a source code into an independent executable file (therefore using machine code or assembly code), the interpreter is needed at each launch of the interpreted program, to translate.

The interpreter translates a portion of code, executes it and translates then the next portion of code, executes it, and so on. If you have already taken a little look at  programming, you might find that this language has a certain poetry. Programmers often have fun looking for the nicest/most effective way to write a sequence of instructions.

### What does Python do?
Python is both simple and powerful, it allows you to write very simple scripts and has a wide variety of libraries that help you work on more ambitious projects.

* **Web:** Today Python combined with the framework Django is a very accurate technological choice for big websites projects.

* **System:** Python is also frequently used by system admins to create so-called repetitive tasks or simply maintenance tasks. Besides, if you want to create Java applications coded in Python, it is possible thanks to the Jython project.

* **Data Science:**  If you‚Äôre looking for a new job as a data scientist, you‚Äôll find that Python is also required in most job postings for data science roles. According to a 2019 [study](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-most-in-demand-tech-skills-for-data-scientists-d716d10c191d) on job postings, Python appears in nearly 75% of all job postings. Python libraries including tensorflow, scikit-learn, pandas, keras, pytorch, and numpy also appear in many data science job postings.

* **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** AI projects differ from traditional software projects. The differences lie in the technology stack, the skills required for an AI-based project, and the necessity of deep research. To implement your AI aspirations, you should use a programming language that is stable, flexible, and has tools available. Python offers all of this, which is why we see lots of Python AI projects today. 

### Why would you choose Python over other languages?
Python is a language that‚Äôs easy to learn and its code is more readable, and so easier to maintain. It can be up to 5 times more concise than Java language for instance, which boosts the developer productivity and reduces mechanically the amount of bugs.

It's one of the most in-demand programming languages.

A last thing to know about Python: its environment is open, meaning it can work with Java, C++, C#, and so on. 

Python is an interpreted language and it‚Äôs logically slower than a compiled one. So for very big projects, it may be necessary (but very possible!) to combine it with Java, C#, etc.

### Who uses Python?

Many big tech companies use Python. Some examples can be seen in the image below.

## Installation:

### Step 1: Installing Python

#### Installing everything separately

* **Install Python on Linux or MacOS:** If you work in a Linux or MacOS environment, good news: Python is already installed. However, make sure you have a **3.10** or higher. 
````shell
python -V
````

*if this command return an error or a version < 3, try with:*
````shell
python3 -V
````

* **Install Python on Windows:** You can download a Python installation file at this address: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/download/)


### Which version to choose?

Try to use the most recent/stable version. Note that the most used version those days is the **3.10**. 
In this course, you are **required** to have python 3.10 or higher.

There are [compatibility problems between the version 2 and 3 of Python](https://learntocodewith.me/programming/python/python-2-vs-python-3/). And, version 2 is no longer maintained. 

### Step 2: Download Jupyter-Notebook   

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

[Download and install Jupyter-Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)

Open your terminal and type: 
```
jupyter-notebook 
```

### Why Jupyter is data scientists‚Äô computational notebook of choice?

Jupyter is a free, open-source, interactive web tool known as a computational notebook, which researchers can use to combine software code, computational output, explanatory text and multimedia resources in a single document. Computational notebooks have been around for decades, but Jupyter in particular has exploded in popularity over the past couple of years. This rapid uptake has been aided by an enthusiastic community of user‚Äìdevelopers and a redesigned architecture that allows the notebook to speak dozens of programming languages ‚Äî a fact reflected in its name, which was inspired, according to co-founder Fernando P√©rez, by the programming languages Julia (Ju), Python (Py) and R.

### Step 3: Choose a Python editor

* **Visual Studio Code (recommended):** This is one of the most popular editors. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux. It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, .NET). 

  * [Install VSCode]((https://code.visualstudio.com/))
  * [Install Python Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python)

  **Note:** If you‚Äôre an Ubuntu user, download the .deb, double-click on the file and click on install. If you‚Äôre facing dependencies issues, try executing the following command:

  	```sudo apt-get install -f```

* **Sublime Text:** Sublime text has a whole range of plugins that you will soon be hooked! Its basic version is free. A small alert will ask you from time to time if you want to buy a license to support the project but nothing forces you to do it.

  Don‚Äôt forget to install the packagecontrol which will allow you to install the needed tools for your project.

* **Pycharm:** PyCharm is an integrated development environment used to program in Python. Currently, in the community free version, there is not any Jupyter notebook support. ** Check out your Github Student Developer Track to get access to the professional version!**.

  It allows code analysis and contains a graphical debugger. It also allows the management of unit tests, the integration of version management software, and supports web development with Django.

  Developed by the Czech company JetBrains, it is a multi-platform software that runs on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. It is available in professional edition, distributed under proprietary license, and community edition under Apache license.
