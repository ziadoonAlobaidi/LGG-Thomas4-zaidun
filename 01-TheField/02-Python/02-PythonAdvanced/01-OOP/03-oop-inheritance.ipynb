    "For example, suppose we have a child class `Circle` that inherits from a parent class `Shape`. \n",

    "Class `Circle` does not only use the methods and attributes of class `Shape`: it will also be able to define its own methods. Other methods and attributes that will be specific to it, in addition to the methods and attributes of class `Shape`, e.g. `radius`. And it will also be able to redefine the methods of the mother class. Let's see another example. "
