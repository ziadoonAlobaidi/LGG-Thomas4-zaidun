# Get better in Python

## ðŸŒ± Must haves
The chapters that you should absolutely cover, either because we think they're essential or because you will have to use them in projects soon, are:

- 1. OOP
- 2. Exception Handling
- 4. File Handling
- 5. Scraping
- 9. Data Structures

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice to haves
It would be good to go through these chapters once, but we would rather you spent more time on the must-haves if you have not understood them properly:

- 3. Regex
- 6. Concurrency
- 7. Decorators
- 8. Typing
- 10. Unit Testing

## ðŸ¤“ Quiz time
For this round, you will get two quizzes; one on the must haves and one on the nice to haves.
