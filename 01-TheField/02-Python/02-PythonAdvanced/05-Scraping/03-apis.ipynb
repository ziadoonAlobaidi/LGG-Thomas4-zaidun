    "An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of tools and methods that allow different applications to interact with each other. While a **user interface** connects a person to a computer or a software, an **API** connects computers or software to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following example, the user interacts with Uber through an application (graphical user interface) while the Uber application interacts with other applications (Google Maps, banks, ...) through APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"./assets/api.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot of companies and organizations provide APIs which allow your Python code to communicate with them (for example by retrieving data dynamically from their server). Those services can be free or paid and often require you to be authenticated before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to call an API\n",
    "\n",
    "Each API has its own specifications. Basically what we need to know is:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **root URL**, defining the address of the API\n",
    "- A **method** (the most common are `GET` and `POST` but you can find much more [here](https://restfulapi.net/http-methods/))\n",
    "- An **endpoint**, whose role is comparable to a function in python\n",
    "- **Parameters**, that you can compare to the parameters of a function in python\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, you can test an API in the browser directly (at least for `GET` methods). A useful tool for testing more complex API calls is [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, we will of course use Python and our famous `requests` library.\n"
