## Exercise 2 - Logs & checkout

In this exercise, you will have to use Git time-machine features. Use internet and git documentation to find how the commands are used

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in your becode workspace. clone this repository using `git clone git@github.com:becodeorg/git-test-ai.git`

2. Explore the history of the repository to find the answers to the following questions using qui checkout:

    * What was the value of the `TARGET` parameter in the `client.py` at the origin of the repository?

    * How did evolve the value of the `TARGET` parameter through the whole Git repository history?
    * When was the init commit created ? By which user ?

3. Try to use `git diff` to compare file content at different points in time instead of navigating manually using `git checkout`. Try it out with `client.py`.
