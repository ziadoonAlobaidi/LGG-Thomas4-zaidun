## Exercise 1 - First commit

In this exercise, you will have to use the most fundamental `git` commands. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in your becode workspace. Create a folder named `exercise1` and navigate to this repository.
2. Try to run `git status`. What do you see? Why?
3. Initialize a Git repository in this folder by running `git init`.
4. Re-run `git status`. Is the output different? 
5. Create a file `my_code.py`. Start version-controlling the `my_code.py` file.
6. Create 3 commits with changes to the `my_code.py` file.
7. Check the Git logs. What do they see there?
8. Try to navigate in the Git history using `git checkout`. Access each of the distinct commits states and compare how the `my_code.py` file evolves.
