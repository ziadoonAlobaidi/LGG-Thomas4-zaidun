## Exercise 3 - Branching and merging

In this exercise, you will have to use the Git branching and merging model. You will also have to figure out how to deal with merge conflicts. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the folder `exercise1` that you created in the first exercise.
2. Create a branch (choose the name yourself)
3. Commit three different changes to the available files (define yourself what the changes will be)
4. Merge your branch into the `master` branch.
5. Make 2 changes in one of the files and commit them
6. Create a branch `feature_branch` and checkout to that branch.
7. Make 2 changes in the same file at the same lines than before and commit them 
8. Merge the existing branch `feature_branch` into the `master` branch
9. Solve the merge conflict that will happen (choose yourself which outcome is legit)
