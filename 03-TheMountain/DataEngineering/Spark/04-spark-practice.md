# Practice time!

Now let's apply this to real world use-case!

Read streaming data from any of [those APIs](https://github.com/ColinEberhardt/awesome-public-streaming-datasets).

You can also choose any data streaming system to practice, make sure to pick a subject that interest you! That's the best way to learn. ;)

**Make sure to choose a `Streaming API` and NOT a `REST API`.**

Streaming API are also called `web socket APIs`.

## What do I do with those data?

It doesn't matter, the goal for now is to be able to:

- Connect to a data streaming feed with PySpark.
- Analyse and transform data with PySpark.
- Push your code to a Github repo.
