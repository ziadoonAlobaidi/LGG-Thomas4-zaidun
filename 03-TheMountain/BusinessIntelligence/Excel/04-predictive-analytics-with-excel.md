## Predictive Analytics with Excel

As you already know predictive analytics is a branch of advanced analytics that makes predictions about future outcomes using historical data combined with statistical modeling, data mining techniques and machine learning.

We have explored many tools that allow us to make predictive models (Python, PowerBI, Tableau, etc.). These tools will be the prefered option most of the time but you might be curious, what is possible with Excel?

Predictive analytics in Excel will often be a collaboration with other tools but for a basic analysis it might give you quick insights you can build upon. 

Because with Excel, the implementation of these models will be mostly `from scratch` it is also a nice ground to understand the mechanics behind these methods. There is no `magic` library that will do the work for us!

You can follow the tutorial below to learn how to create predictive models with Excel.

## Python Integration

The main limitations of Excel today, however, is around larger data sets. The larger the data set, the more difficulties you face in Excel. 

At the same time, people hate change. People are comfortable in Excel, and they donâ€™t really want to move away from it. It is, therefore, our job to make that transition easier. Provide more speed, more functionality, without ever leaving the spreadsheet.

Until Excel can support big data, this is where Python comes in! 

### Python Packages

* [xlwings](https://www.xlwings.org/) is an open-core spreadsheet automation package with a beautiful API. It's a sane alternative to VBA macros/UDFs and Power Query and works across Excel on Windows and macOS, Excel on the Web, and Google Sheets. xlwings is easy to deploy, has powerful reporting features, and comes with an ultra fast file reader that doesn't require an Excel installation.

* [openpyxl](https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/): A library to read and write Excel 2010 files. You can write new worksheets, edit existing ones, and do pretty much any operation you can do using the mouse in Excel. Its superpower? It supports pretty much any Excel extension!

* [xlrd](https://xlrd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): A library for reading data and formatting information in Excel files.

* [xlsxwriter](https://pypi.org/project/XlsxWriter/): Probably the most complete all things Excel Python library.

Formatting, Conditional Formatting, Charts, Merged Cells, Filters, Comments, Integration with Pandas are only some of the features it offers. If you are looking to use the full functionality of Excel through Python scripts, you can start here!
