# Permissions

Type of challenge: **Learning**  
Duration: **30 min**  
Team challenge: **solo**

## Learning objectives

At the end of this challenge you should be able to:

- Execute a command as root
- Check the permissions of a file
- Change the permissions of a file
- Change the owner of a file
- Change the group of a file

## Requirements

This briefing assumes that you know how to:

- Consult the manual within the terminal
- Create and read files in the terminal
- List a directory contents

## The mission

You’ve heard of four new tools to manage permissions and execute commands with administrative rights `sudo`, `chmod`,
`chown` and `chgrp`. Open your **terminal** and **read their manuals** to understand them, then follow the instructions
below.

- Create a file
- Check the owner and group of the file (use `ls` or ![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `icacls`)
- Change its owner to **root**
- Change its group to **root**
- Check that file’s permission (use `ls` or ![Windows icon](./assets/win_icon.png) `icacls`)
- Give all rights to owner and group, but none to others
- Try to print the file on screen
- Print the file with root privileges

## Congrats

Permissions and ownership can be tough to grasp, but they allow for multiple people to work on the same system with all
their data secured.
