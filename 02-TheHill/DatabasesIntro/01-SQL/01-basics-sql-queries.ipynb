    "A **relational database** is a way of structuring information in tables, rows, and columns. You could compare it to an excel file (database) with several sheets (tables) that contain tabular data (rows and columns). The particularity of this database is its ability to create relationships between those tables by joining them.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a `join`? Let's take an example by looking at the schema of a database of a music producer. You can see here that certain fields are common between several tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: `ArtistID` exists in `artists` and in `albums`. Consequently the information from an artist can be included (_joined_) to the information of his/her albums.\n",

    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) is one of the most common languages for interacting with a relational database. It allows you to perform efficient and precise queries on the database, including queries among different tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL mainly allows you to `select`, `insert`, `update` or `delete` data from the DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving in the exercises:\n",

    "- You can learn the basics of SQL language by practicing [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp)\n",
    "- Try to understand the structure of the DB based on its schema. You will get more information about it [here](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-sample-database/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's do some exercices by using SQLite and the python module `sqlite3`. You don't need to install it, it is included in the Python distribution. Read more: [SQLite3 Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html).\n",
