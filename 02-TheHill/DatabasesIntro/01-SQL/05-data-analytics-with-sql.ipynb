Data analysis is part data discovery, part data interpretation, and part data communication. Very often the purpose of data analysis is to improve decision making, by humans and increasingly by machines through automation.\n","\n","\n","## What is SQL?\n","\n","`SQL` is the language used to communicate with databases. The acronym stands for `Structured Query Language` and is pronounced either like “sequel” or by saying each letter, as in “ess cue el.” This is only the first of many controversies and inconsistencies surrounding SQL that we’ll see, but most people will know what you mean regardless of how you say it. \n","\n","There is some debate as to whether SQL is or isn’t a programming\n","language. It isn’t a general purpose language in the way that C or Python\n","are. SQL without a database and data in tables is just a text file. SQL can’t build a website, but it is powerful for working with data in databases. \n","\n","<img src=\"assets/sql.png\" width = 500 px></img>\n","\n","\n","On a practical level, what matters most is that SQL can help you get the job of data analysis done.  It allows use to interact and capture the relationships between different sources of data. \n","\n","\n","SQL is designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS). It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.\n","\n","## SQL vs. Pandas\n","If you have experience with `pandas` you will notice that there is a big overlap between what you can do with SQL and pandas Read more: \n","- [Pandas vs. SQL Cheat Sheet](https://datascientyst.com/pandas-vs-sql-cheat-sheet/)\n","- [SQL vs Python: Which Should You Learn?](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/sql-vs-python-which-to-learn) \n","- [Comparison with SQL (pandas documentation)](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/comparison/comparison_with_sql.html)\n","\n","In the broader picture,which one you use depends on your goal, for the most part: \n","* SQL is more efficient in querying data but it has less functions whereas in pandas, there might be lag for large volumes of data but it has more functions which enable us to manipulate data in an effective way. \n","* SQL works on a relational model which makes linking tables via keys much easier and regulates the entry of data in other tables in case of a foreign key constraint but Pandas makes data manipulation much easier.\n","* Pandas is better if you intend to manipulate the data or plot it as it does it all in one place whereas in SQL we have to use Tableau for data visualization\n","\n","However, by knowing both (and when to use them), you can combine the power of both to your advantage.\n","\n","## Why use SQL?\n","\n","Perhaps the best reason to use SQL is that much of the world’s data is already in databases. It’s likely your own organization has one or more databases. Even if data is not already in a database, loading it into one can be worthwhile in order to take advantage of the storage and computing advantages, especially when compared to alternatives  such as spreadsheets. \n","\n","SQL is the de facto standard for interacting with databases and retrieving data from them. A wide range of popular software connects to databases with SQL, from spreadsheets to BI and visualization tools and coding languages such as Python and R.\n","\n","When deciding whether to use SQL, R, or Python for an analysis, consider:\n","\n","* Where is the data located—in a database, a file, a website?\n","* What is the volume of data?\n","* Where is the data going—into a report, a visualization, a statistical analysis?\n","* Will it need to be updated or refreshed with new data? How often?\n","* What does your team or organization use, and how important is it to conform to existing standards?\n","\n","<img src=\"./assets/sql_in_data_analysis.png\" width = 500px></img>\n","\n","Source: [SQL for Data Analysis by Cathy Tanimura](https://www.amazon.in/SQL-Data-Analysis-Cathy-Tanimura-ebook/dp/B09FX81BDM)\n","\n","SQL shines in the storage and ETL parts of a data pipeline. SQL is applied to explore, profile, clean, shape, and analyze the data.\n","\n","In the next few sections, we will dive into how to integrate SQL in our data pipeline. We can use SQL to perform many types of data analyses: timeseries, cohorts, text, anomaly detection, etc. \n","\n","What is different now vs. when using Python? Our goal using SQL is mostly to prepare the data for the next step of the process (i.e. exploratory data analysis, modeling, ect.). In this section, we'll walk through one example on how we can leverage SQL for data analysis\n","\n","# The Data\n","\n","The SQL examples we will see are based on the book *SQL for Data Analysis by Cathy Tanimura* who has made the datasets from the book avalaible in this Github Repository: https://github.com/cathytanimura/sql_book.\n","\n","## The Mission: Retail Spending Patterns\n","\n","Let's say you work for the US Goverment and are interested in knowing consumer spending patterns.

A common one is to discover patterns in the data. \n","\n","**Seasonality** is any pattern that repeats over regular intervals. Unlike other noise in the data, seasonality can be predicted. The word seasonality brings to mind the four seasons of the year—spring, summer, fall, winter—and some data sets include these patterns. \n","\n","Shopping patterns change with the seasons, from the clothes and food people buy to the money spent on leisure and travel. The winter holiday shopping season can be make-or-break for many retailers. Let's take a look at out data!\n","\n","To understand whether seasonality exists in a time series, and at what scale, it’s useful to graph it and then visually inspect for patterns. We can try aggregating at different levels, from hourly to daily, weekly, and monthly. \n","\n","You should also incorporate knowledge about the data set. Are there patterns that you can guess based on what you know about the entity or process it represents? \n","\n","### Period-over-Period Comparisons: YoY and MoM\n","\n","Period-over-period comparisons can take multiple forms. The first one is to compare a time period to the previous value in the series, a practice so common in analysis that there are acronyms for the most often-used comparisons. Depending on the level of aggregation the comparison might be year-over-year (YoY), month-over-month (MoM), day-over-day (DoD), and so on.\n","\n","For these calculations we’ll use the `lag function`, another one of the window functions.
