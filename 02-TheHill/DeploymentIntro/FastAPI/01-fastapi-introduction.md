# FastAPI Survival Guide

[FastAPI](https://FastAPI.tiangolo.com/) is a micro web framework powered by Python. Its API is fairly small, making it easy to learn and simple to use.

But don’t let this fool you, as it’s powerful enough to support enterprise-level applications handling large amounts of traffic.

You can start small with an app contained entirely in one file, then slowly scale up to multiple files and folders in a well-structured manner as your site becomes more and more complex.

It's an excellent framework to start with, which you’ll be learning in true "Real Python-style": with hands-on, practical examples that are interesting and fun.

But one of the most interesting feature of FastPi is the **automatic interactive documentation**. Why is this so great?

Because it means that you can **test your API** from the documentation page. You can **send requests** with the **parameters** you want, and **get the results** as **JSON**. Also, you will work with other data scientists and developers, and they will be able to **test your API** from the documentation page without any additional work from you!

## The key features are:

* **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
* **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
* **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.
* **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
* **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
* **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
* **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
* **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

## Introduction
Here is a nice 20mins video that will introduce you to FastAPI with good practices and examples: [FastAPI in 20 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7t2alSnE2-I).

## Do I need to know or learn HTML?

**NO** you do not.

FastAPI is designed to create web application or API.

Yes, you can build complete websites and web apps with it, no you don't need to.

In this course, and as a data scientist, having a basic understanding of HTML will help you. Especially for web scraping.

But you won't be asked to create a raw website in html,css,js. **We use FastAPI to get and send back JSON data**. That's what we will focus on.

## Production

FastAPI is not designed to be used in production as it is. You can easily run your file for development purpose. But when it come to production, there are additional steps that need to be performed.
You will need to use Gunicorn/NGX for example.

To know more about it: [look at the official documentation](https://FastAPI.tiangolo.com/deployment/).

## Next steps

Now that you know what FastAPI is, let's see how to install it and use it. But you are not in the Field anymore! Now, you need to learn to read the documentation. So, let's go to the [official documentation](https://FastAPI.tiangolo.com/).

Also, as we are nice people, for your first non-guided project, we choosed a documentation that is amazingly well written. So, you will be able to learn a lot from it.

You will see that the FastAPI documentation is one of the best documentation you will ever read. It is clear, well structured, and you can find everything you need in it. So, you will have to learn to read it. And you will have to learn to read it well. Because you will need to read a lot of documentation in your life as a data scientist.
