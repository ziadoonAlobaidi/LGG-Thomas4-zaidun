# Data cleaning and preprocessing

Data cleaning is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set. In other words, whenever the data is gathered from different sources it is collected in a raw format that is (usually) not ideal for the analysis.

In a typical machine learning project, data cleaning and preprocessing is responsible for **80% of the work**. Thus, it is of the utmost importance that you know how to do it (and do it well).

Data cleaning and preprocessing are two different steps so we'll have two separate sections to introduce the concepts.

The following list gathers common libraries used for data manipulation:
- [`pandas-profiling` - Awesome profiling tool](https://pypi.org/project/pandas-profiling/)
- [`scikit-learn` - Structured data cleaning and preprocessing](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [`pandas` - Structured data cleaning and preprocessing](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [`scikit-image` - Image data cleaning and preprocessing](https://scikit-image.org/)
- [`opencv` - Computer vision library](https://opencv.org/)
