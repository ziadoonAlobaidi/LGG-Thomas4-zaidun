    "## Exercise 4\n",
    "Let's dive into the serious business now!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "[Kaggle](http://www.kagle.com/) is a great platform to learn machine learning. They offer free datasets and organize competitions around them. You can even be paid if you win one of them!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you know how to build a classifier, try with [the titanic dataset!](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. Download the dataset.\n",
    "2. Import it in a jupyter notebook.\n",
    "3. Analyse the data.\n",
    "4. Divide the dataset. (train data and test data)\n",
    "5. Build a classifier using the algorithm of you choice and fit it with your train data.\n",
    "6. Evaluate the model with your test data.\n",
    "7. When you're satisfied with the result, fit your model with the complete dataset.\n",
    "8. Predict the Kaggle's test set and [submit your prediciton](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview).\n",
    "9. Which score did you get?\n",
    "\n",
    "**DISCLAIMER:** If you look at Kaggle's leaderboard, you will see a lot of people have a score of 100%. They just found the name of people that survived online. Great lesson here, when you are learning something, never compare yourself to others. All that matters is what you've learned."
