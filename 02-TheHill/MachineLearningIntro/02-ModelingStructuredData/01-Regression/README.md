# Linear regression

Welcome to the machine learning world! Let's learn about linear regression.

## Learning objectives

### Must-have
* Be able to identify linear problems and describe them in the simplest mathematical terms.
* Be able to explain the main steps behind creating a linear model (**Load > Split > Preprocess > Train > Evaluate** & _iterate_)
* Be able to split a dataset into a training set and a test set with `train_test_split()` from `sklearn.model_selection`
* Be able to preprocess a dataset 
    - Know how to use `StandardScaler()` from `sklearn.preprocessing` for continuous variables
    - Know how to use `OneHotEncoder()` from `sklearn.preprocessing` for discrete variables
    - Know how to creatively add additional features to your dataset ~ **feature engineering**
* Be able to fit a linear model using `scikit-learn`'s `.fit()` method
* Be able to compute and explain the appropriate evaluation metrics for a linear model with `mean_squared_error()` and `r2_score()` from `sklearn.metrics`
* Be able to store your model object using `pickle` or `joblib`
* Be able to write your model training code in a separate script
* Be able to load your model object and make predictions with it in a separate script

### Nice-to-have
* Be able to create a polynomial model.
* Be able to work with matrices and implement them in code.
* Be able to explain the notion of a cost function and how gradient descent works.
* Be able to use the `Pipeline()` functionality from `sklearn.pipeline`.

## May the linear force be with you!
